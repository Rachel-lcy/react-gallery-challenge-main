# React Gallery

This is a practice repo where you'll aim to complete the objectives outlined below in challenges. Some of them can be done out of order, but it'll be up to you to figure out what to do and when

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Challenges

### Organize Assets

- rename the image files so they're easier to understand
- create an array of objects that contains the paths and alt texts
- store this in a data.js file (research for best practices on where to store this file)
- test that you can import the file into App.js and get the files to show up in the DOM

### Add a CSS Framework

- Find and follow the correct directions in [Tailwindcss install instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite).
- Look at the files in this repo closely to determine the correct install approach

### Create Components for a Gallery

- Gallery layout component that accepts an array of images.
- On the page level, create the image array that has the image paths and alt text
- A gallery image element that accepts the image path, alt text, and any other content that you want to display with the image
- Make use of props so the components are more dynamic

### Create a gallery page

- Make a page to showcase your gallery
- Add a component for a standardized page header that accepts title, subtitle and other props that make sense (style props, background image)
- Refactor your imports so this is the gallery that was previously on App.js

### Test gallery component reusability

- Download some more images and add them to your repo
- Create a smaller gallery with these images on the home page
- Edit the css and/or make other components to accomodate the needed flexibility
